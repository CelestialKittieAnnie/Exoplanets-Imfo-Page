            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets outside our solar system. As of February 2025, there are over 5,800 confirmed exoplanets. These planets are discovered using various methods such as the transit method, radial velocity method, and direct imaging. Exoplanets are diverse, with various sizes, compositions, and atmospheres. Some are gas giants like Jupiter, while others are rocky planets similar to Earth. Studying exoplanets helps us understand planetary formation and the potential for life beyond our solar system.</p>

            <h2>Discovery Methods</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets are discovered using various methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transit Method:</strong> Detects the dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it. This method has discovered thousands of exoplanets, including Kepler-186f.</li>
                <li><strong>Radial Velocity Method:</strong> Measures the star's wobble due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. Proxima Centauri b was discovered using this method.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Imaging:</strong> Captures images of exoplanets by blocking the star's light. This method is challenging but provides direct observations of exoplanets.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Microlensing:</strong> Detects the bending of light from a distant star caused by the gravitational field of an intervening planet.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="missions">
            <h2>Missions</h2>
            <p>Several missions have been launched to discover and study exoplanets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kepler:</strong> Discovered thousands of exoplanets using the transit method. The mission operated from 2009 to 2018.</li>
                <li><strong>TESS:</strong> Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, launched in 2018, focuses on finding small planets around the brightest stars near Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>James Webb Space Telescope:</strong> Launched in 2021, it will study the atmospheres of exoplanets in greater detail, searching for signs of habitability and potential biosignatures.</li>
                <li><strong>PLATO:</strong> PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars, planned for launch in 2026, will search for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.</li>
            </ul>
